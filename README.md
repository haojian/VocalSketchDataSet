## Overview
This document describes the dataset for the paper "VocalSketch: Vocally Imitating Audio Concepts"

## Description of directories
* included_vocal_imitations - This directory contains all of the vocal imitation recordings that met our inclusion criteria and were included in our analysis
* excluded_vocal_imitations - This directory contains all of the vocal imitation recordings that did not meet our inclusion criteria and were not included in our analysis
* sound_recordings - This directory contains the audio files for the referent 'sound recording' audio concepts. NOTE: If you want to obtain the 'everyday' sounds you must obtain them from http://marcellm.people.cofc.edu/confrontation%20sound%20naming/confront.htm since we cannot redistribute them.
